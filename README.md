# 👋 Hi, I'm Raj Kumar

I'm a **Machine Learning Researcher** and **PhD (MS-leading) scholar in Electronics Engineering** at **Jeju National University, South Korea**.  

My work focuses on:

- **Generative AI & Large Language Models (LLMs)**  
- **Multimodal forecasting for renewable energy (solar & wind)**  
- **Image-based defect detection with advanced data augmentation**  
- **Embedding-based symbolic–numeric reasoning for real-world systems**

I love turning messy, real-world data (logs, images, time series) into **robust, scalable ML systems** that actually survive deployment.
