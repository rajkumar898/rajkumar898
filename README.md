👋 Hi there! I'm Raj Kumar

Machine Learning Researcher | Generative AI Specialist | LLMs & Multimodal AI

I'm a research-driven Machine Learning Scholar at Jeju National University, South Korea, specializing in Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), multimodal embedding architectures, and synthetic data generation for real-world applications in renewable energy, biotech, and autonomous systems.

I design advanced AI systems that integrate symbolic–numeric reasoning, diffusion-based augmentation, and feature-level balancing frameworks to solve complex forecasting, detection, and optimization problems.
